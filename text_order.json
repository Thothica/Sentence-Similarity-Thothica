urban vegetable garden in the Iztapalapa district, Mexico", "PHOTO: REUTERS Endnotes: 1 Also known as global environmental goals", "The compilation of the goals is ongoing and available at http://geg.informea.org/ THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY 2018-2021 2 The new agenda acknowledges the integrated nature of the many challenges that humanity faces, from gender inequality to inadequate infrastructure and from youth unemployment to environmental degradation", "In the preamble to the 2030 Agenda, world leaders affirmed that they were determined to protect the planet from degradation, including through sustainable consumption and production, sustainable manage- ment of its natural resources and urgent action on climate change, so that it could support the needs of present and future generations", "A synthesis report of the United Nations Secretary-General on the post-2015 sustainable development agenda states that the 2030 Agenda represents a truly universal and transformational course for sustainable development", "Achieving the 2030 Agenda will require a new paradigm for sustainable development in which work on issues such as health, education and, critically, the environment, is no longer conducted in silos, but is intrinsically linked", "Over 86 targets in the 2030 Agenda are concerned with environmental sustain- ability, including at least one in each of the 17 Goals", "Within this framework, the medium-term strategy of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for the period 2018 - 2021 is informed by relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations Environment Assembly, the General Assembly and the UNEP Governing Council, and by the strategies and plans of multilateral environmental agreements and other inter- nationally agreed environmental goals.1 Taking these directives as its starting point, UNEP will exercise its leadership role in the United Nations system and with other partners on environmental matters, which will entail promoting coherence in the way the United Nations system integrates the environment into sustain- able development", "Within its mandate, UNEP will also support countries in their efforts to become more environmentally sustainable, while balancing the integration of the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development", "The medium-term strategy sets out an analysis of the signi\ufb01cant environmental challenges that the world will face in the coming years (section 2)", "Climate change remains a pressing issue and must be addressed through enhanced adaptation and a reduc- tion in greenhouse gas emissions", "Equally important is resilience to industrial accidents, con\ufb02icts and natural disasters, which are becoming more frequent and more damaging with the warming climate", "Biodiversity is key to maintaing healthy and productive ecosystems, which in turn are necessary for conserving \ufb02ora and fauna, and to providing a large range of ecosystem services such as drinking water and secure food systems", "There is a need to make better use of our natural resources for economic and social growth, to improve management of waste and chemical products and set up effective laws, policies and institutions to govern actions that affect the environment", "There is also a need to monitor the state of the planet\u2019s health in order to gain a better understanding of the full extent of the challenges faced", "The medium-term strategy recognizes that achieving the environ- mental objectives of sustainable development takes time", "It acknowledges this important lesson by de\ufb01ning an ambitious 2030 vision for UNEP (section 3) and aligning itself with the principles contained in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d, as well as the 2030 Agenda", "The comparative advantage of UNEP in this work is to provide an environmental lens through which to view, understand and advise on sustainable development", "Section 4 de\ufb01nes how decisions will be made through the operating principles of UNEP", "The focus of the work of UNEP in the coming years is outlined in sections 5 and 6, which are organized into thematic subprogrammes that chart the path towards realizing the UNEP vision for 2030, while section 7 sets out the business model of", "the organization", "The strong focus of UNEP on results is mirrored by its approach to evaluation, as detailed in section 8", "Such measures will ensure that UNEP is better positioned to address environmental challenges and ultimately build a healthier, more sustainable world for all", "In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which cut across disciplines, sectors and institutional mandates", "3 THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY 2018-2021 SITUATION ANALYSIS Mountain landscape in

Metabolic rates are the \u201cmaterial footprint\u201d of an individual person living by a certain country\u2019s average level of consumption calculated as resources used per capita, where resources include construction minerals, ores and industrial minerals, fossil fuels, and biomass", "The world environment is continuously evolving and UNEP must operate within that context", "Many of our most pressing environmental challenges are driven by large, transformative global forces that impact everyone on the planet", "Resource ef\ufb01ciency and changing demographics By 2050, population growth will put further pressure on the planet\u2019s ecosystems and the goods and services they provide", "Growing food and water scarcity will make it even harder for people living in developing countries to eat a healthy diet, access clean water and practice good hygiene (\ufb01gure 1)", "Growing demographic pressures, compounded by patterns of over-consump- tion, will deplete our supply of natural resources and increase waste production, resulting in negative social, health and economic consequences", "Escalating resource use is causing signi\ufb01cant environmental pressure to the extent that a business-as- usual scenario could more than triple global resource extraction and per capita CO2 emissions by the middle of the twenty-\ufb01rst century (\ufb01gure 2).3 The depletion of natural resources will hinder long-term economic growth, while exacerbating global inequalities", "At the same time, intensive mining, logging, agribusiness and oil and gas extraction could \u2013 if poorly managed \u2013 increase the risk of environment degradation and pollution, potentially triggering tensions in local communities", "Urbanization is another important driving force for environmental change", "The urban population, as a proportion of the overall population, is expected to rise to 70 per cent by 2050,4 by which time the world\u2019s cities will be generating 75 per cent of global waste and greenhouse gas emissions (\ufb01gure 3)", "However, a more concentrated population presents a strategic opportunity to improve environmental sustainability, as more people can be more easily reached", "FIGURE 2: Implications of per capita resource consumption in three growth and development models 5 THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY 2018-2021 global greenhouse gas emissions global waste total

pervasive and threatening issues of our time, with far-reaching impacts in the twenty-\ufb01rst century.5 Temperature changes and sea-level rise are already affecting human well-being in many places, including coastal zones and small island developing States.6 According to data set out in the \ufb01fth edition of the UNEP Global Environment Outlook (GEO-5) and the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate change is also putting signi\ufb01cant pressure on ecosystems", "Climatic variations and extreme weather events can also lead to large social and economic costs", "Taking urgent action on climate change will therefore remain critical in the", "period 2018\u20132021 and beyond", "Climate change is expected to have major and unprecedented social and economic implica- tions on where people can settle, grow food, build cities, and rely on functioning ecosystems for the services they provide", "The effects are likely to hit women harder than men, particularly in developing countries, given that women represent the majority of the world\u2019s poor and are often more socially excluded", "Since 2000, natural disasters have killed more than 1.1 million people and affected another 2.7 billion, with \ufb02oods, droughts and windstorms the most frequent events.7 Climate change could sharply increase the number of people forced from their homes as a result of land degradation and extreme weather events, which in turn can increase environmental pressures in the areas they \ufb02ee to", "The UNEP Adaptation Gap Report 2014 stated that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are cut to the level required to keep the rise of global temperature below 2\u00b0C in the twenty-\ufb01rst century, the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries is likely to reach two to three times the previous estimates of $70 billion -$100 billion per year by 2050.8 Member States meeting at the twenty-\ufb01rst session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015 adopted a universal agreement aiming to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty", "It sets the world on a course to a zero-carbon, resilient, prosperous and fair future", "The Paris Agreement will capitalize and accelerate the momentum created by the intended nationally determined contributions submitted by Member States and the remarkable momentum from non-State actors", "The Emissions Gap Report 2015 of UNEP assessed 119 intended nationally determined contributions that countries submitted to the secretariat of the Framework Convention on Climate Change by 1 October 2015", "It found that efforts to tackle climate change, including those taken before the Paris agreement was adopted and before the full imple- mentation of the intended nationally determined contributions, could cut up to 11 GtCO2e from projected emissions in 2030, which is around half of the total required to reach the global emission level (42 GtCO2e in 2030) consistent with a likely chance of staying below the \u201csafe\u201d level of a global FIGURE 3: Current impact of cities in global greenhouse emissions, global waste and total population Since 2000 more than, 1.1 million

signi\ufb01cant action through the Convention to combat climate change and its impacts, including by non-State actors10 and through clean energy use", "Chemicals, waste and air quality Cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other non-commu- nicable diseases, many of which are associated with air and water pollution, are on the rise", "Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa alone account for 40 per cent of the global burden of disease", "In almost all countries, per capita health-care expenditure is rising faster than per capita income; in some countries, health-care expenditure will increase from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of gross domestic product by 2024", "How is this an environmental challenge? Better and sound management of chemicals and waste and improved water and air quality can signi\ufb01cantly lower disease rates, especially among vulnerable groups", "For example, by 2030, measures taken by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer may prevent up to two million cases of skin cancer globally per year", "Reducing environmental stress will reduce health risks in vulnerable groups, but this can only be achieved through an integrated approach, with partners across the environment and health sectors working together", "Climate change is not the only major concern regarding the planet\u2019s atmosphere", "Figure 4 shows other factors related to air pollution", "The \ufb01gures given are more than double those of previous estimates and con\ufb01rm that air pollution is among the world\u2019s largest environmental health risks.11 A study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Devel- opment found that, in 2010, the cost of air pollu- tion in China was approximately $1.4 trillion, while", "Europe lost around $140 billion to $230 billion due to reduced air quality in 2009", "In its resolution 1/7, on strengthening the role of UNEP in promoting air quality, the United Nations Environment Assembly recognized the importance of addressing the issue of air pollution in a manner that integrated the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development", "Chemicals that need sustained attention are those addressed under the chemicals and waste-related Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides FIGURE 4: Air pollution and its effects on human health Estimated at 20-50 million tonnes per year, e-waste is becoming a major environmental challenge", "7 THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY 2018-2021 in International Trade and Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants; the Minamata Convention on Mercury; and the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management, including persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals and other chemicals that disrupt hormone systems", "Similarly, industrial chemicals and hazardous and other wastes, including electronic waste (e-waste), require continued efforts", "As the fastest-growing waste stream in the world, estimated at 20-50 million tonnes per year,12 e-waste is becoming a major environmental challenge.13 Emerging data show that the costs of using and producing harmful chemicals is quite high in terms of economic costs, health impacts, environmental degradation and effects on development planning", "In its resolution 1/5, on chemicals and waste, the United Nations Environ- ment Assembly affirmed that a new approach was needed to minimize the risks of novel technologies and chemicals.14 Healthy and productive ecosystems We must help the planet to become more resilient to change by sustainably managing forests, combating deserti\ufb01cation, addressing land degradation, halting biodiversity loss and, more broadly, by protecting, restoring and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems", "These have all been identi\ufb01ed as priority issues by the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity,15 and the 10-year strategic plan to enhance the implementation of United Nations Convention to Combat Deserti\ufb01cation in those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Deserti\ufb01cation, Particularly in Africa (2008 - 2018)", "Oceans face signi\ufb01cant threats, such as over\ufb01shing, climate change and pollution.16 Marine debris is found in all parts of the ocean and is harming wildlife, \ufb01sheries and coastal economies, which poses a potential health risk to humans given that plastic and harmful chemicals ingested by marine wildlife and seabirds can be transported through the food chain", "Micro- plastics17 are also increasingly used in a wide range of goods, such as toothpastes and facial cleaners.18 The UNEP Regional Seas Programme and the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activi- ties are leading the response to the United Nations Environment Assembly resolution 1/6 on marine plastic debris and microplastics", "According to the Global Biodiversity Outlook 4,19 pressures on biodiversity will continue to increase at least until 2020 and, as a result, biodiversity will continue to decline", "The Global Risks Perception Survey 2014 highlighted that three of the top ten risks over the next ten years will be environmental, with one of the top three being biodiversity loss", "The degradation of freshwater and marine ecosystems will increasingly affect biodiversity20 and the provision of important goods (such as food, water, \ufb01bre and fuel) and services (such as nutrient cycling, puri\ufb01cation, \ufb02ood and climate regulation) that sustain human existence and livelihoods.21 GEO-5 and other key scienti\ufb01c reports such as Global Biodiversity Outlook 4 indicate that unsus- tainable exploitation of resources, compounded by climate change and pollution of the air, land and water, including habitat changes and the spread of invasive alien species, will result in substantial biodiversity loss", "This will negatively affect the status and functioning of ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services, with subsequent impacts on food security, livelihoods and poverty reduction efforts", "Examples are the collapse of \ufb01sheries, the alteration of hydrological cycles and the loss of species used for medicinal purposes", "SITUATION ANALYSIS 8 Ocean acidi\ufb01cation is another major challenge to the environment", "Rising CO2 levels in the atmos- phere are affecting the acidity of oceans, which in turn, when paired with warmer sea temperatures and human-induced stresses, makes tropical reef ecosystems vulnerable to collapse.22 Meeting the Aichi Biodiversity targets23 will contribute to the broader global priorities addressed by the 2030 Agenda, namely reducing hunger and poverty, improving human health and ensuring a sustainable supply of energy, food and clean water", "Environmental governance Illegal trade in wildlife has risen to crisis levels for some species, with close to 25,000 elephants killed in 2013 alone.24 An increase", "in transnational crime, which also comprises illegal logging and \ufb01shing, affects governance efforts and hinders socioeconomic development", "Violent con\ufb02ict can be triggered, \ufb01nanced and prolonged by disputes over natural resources and leave devastating environmental legacies", "Illegal logging, trafficking in waste, corruption poaching and the associated illegal trade are symptomatic of the failures in natural resources governance and enforcement", "Member States, through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the International Criminal Police Organisation and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, are increas- ingly partnering to eradicate this problem", "In response, the United Nations Environment Assembly at its \ufb01rst session adopted resolution 1/3 to address illegal trade in wildlife and its adverse effects on ecosystems and livelihoods, which was endorsed by the General Assembly at its seventieth session", "To effectively address environmental priorities at any level, adequate and effective governance structures and normative and policy foundations are essential", "Aligning environmental governance structures to the challenges of global

been recognized through Rio Principle 10 and subsequent guidelines and resolutions,27 as has the need to involve all institutions and actors in promoting environmental sustainability and combating violations of environmental law.28 Effective implemen- tation and compliance with multilateral environmental agreement commitments will continue to be high on the agenda of UNEP during the period 2018-2021", "Keeping the environment under review Earth systems are being pushed to their biophysical limits and there is evidence that those limits are either close to being reached or have already been exceeded", "They include changes to the bio-geochem- ical cycles (especially nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus), biodiversity loss and climate change", "Half of the Sustainable Development Goals have an environmental focus or address the sustainability of natural resources", "At least one target in each of the 17 Goals concerns environmental sustainability, meaning that progress on one cannot be achieved if there is no progress on others", "Goals with an environ- mental focus include Goal 6 (ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all), Goal 7 (ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all), Goal 9 (build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation), Goal 11 (make cities and human settle- ments inclusive, safe, resilient and sustain- able), Goal 12 (ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns), Goal 13 (take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts), Goal 14 (conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development) and Goal 15 (protect, restore and promote sustain- able use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustain- ably manage forests, combat deserti\ufb01ca- tion, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss)", "For the other Goals, a healthy environ- ment is essential for their achievement", "To track progress towards these and other global environmental goals, UNEP estab- lished six regional environmental informa- tion networks (REIN) and developed a common approach within the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) for indicator-based reporting and assess- ment to keep the environment under review", "The biennial REIN meetings and regular GEO assessments could play an important role in delivering the evidence base for reviewing progress on the environ- mental dimension of sustainable develop- ment", "If a four-yearly cycle is

(\ufb01gure 6) shows how UNEP will coordinate and focus actions to respond to environmental challenges and realize the 2030 vision", "UNEP will support Governments and other United Nations agencies while leading efforts to leverage impact through partnerships and achieve coher- ence and improve collaboration on environmental issues across the United Nations System", "UNEP will also monitor and track these impacts to be able to identify change, adjust its business model, enhance its effectiveness and efficiency and communicate achievements and lessons learnt", "These themes will run through all of the subprogrammes of UNEP", "Through strategic partnerships, UNEP will catalyze transformative change, leverage impact in the environ- mental dimension of sustainable development and contribute to the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development", "For example, development banks, health organiza- tions and others can build on the work of UNEP to improve environmental sustainability to accrue bene\ufb01ts in the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development", "Member States will bene\ufb01t from the strengthened presence of UNEP in regions and

ence, taking advantage of its environmental leadership and strategic partnerships", "The regional presence of UNEP will call upon the wider UNEP network expertise to support regional needs", "The medium-term strategy will unfold in each region or across regions through the programme of work, in response to regions\u2019 and countries\u2019 priorities, including national follow-up and support in the implementation of the Goals and targets", "Subpro- gramme coordinators located in the regions, along with regional-level technical, operational and manage- ment expertise and leadership are being gradually strengthened to drive strategic engagement, particularly in terms of upscaling work through partnerships at the regional level", "UNEP will strengthen its communications and fundraising expertise in the regions to support regional delivery", "The outcomes of the medium-term strategy in the regions will feed into the global monitoring and reporting systems of UNEP to inform intergovernmental forums, networks, partners and platforms at regional and global levels ,as well as UNEP governance bodies", "UNEP service lines are a core element of the business model, which help staff and partners to ensure that their everyday activities are linked in a coherent, consistent manner to the implementation of the strategy", "Built on strengths and comparative advantages that create value, the service lines will be central to delivering results in the period 2018-2021 as a step towards 2030 impact", "An expert uses a UNEP air quality measuring device, expected to cost up

share knowledge and best practices, facilitate technology transfer and identify innovative solutions to environmental challenges", "UNEP, in partnership with United Nations entities, will convene those responsible for social, economic and development policy, in\ufb02uence investment decisions and in\ufb02uence consumer choice", "Such an expansion of the constituencies UNEP works with, especially in the economic and social arena, will be a change from previous medium-term strategy periods", "A key aim will be to empower the environment sector to mobilize these key constituencies with the support of the convening power of UNEP, within the mandate of UNEP", "Enhance public advocacy, brand and digital engagement strategies to better inform, in\ufb02uence and mobilize a broad range of relevant stakeholders across sectors", "Enhancing the clarity and consistency of the organization\u2019s voice will affect the capacity of UNEP to gain and maintain public and policy attention within the strategic priority areas", "The organization is poised to leverage a growing (digital) audience and reach a signi\ufb01cantly larger number of stakeholders than it presently does", "The organization is increasingly committed to delivering results that require social mobilization and behaviour and social change communication", "By", "better exploiting digital platforms, by conceiving coherent, evidence-based communication strategies that effectively leverage partnerships and build upon the UNEP network of opinion makers and prominent personalities, particularly by creating and strengthening spaces for conversation with and among youth and millennials", "Providing technical assistance for strengthened environmental policies, norms and institutions UNEP will continue to identify science for policy and decision-making to achieve the environmental dimension of sustainable development, integrating social, economic and development considerations to enable policy-relevant responses and responding to resolution 4 of the \ufb01rst session of the United Nations Environment Assembly", "UNEP will provide technical guidance and support for environmental governance, developing laws and policies, and ensure that these are coherent and can be implemented effectively", "This is to ensure that countries have frameworks for environmental laws and institutions in place and that environmental considerations underpin social, economic and development policy, an evolution from previous medium-term strategy periods", "Implementation and enforcement of such laws and policies, including those relating to the implementation of and compliance with the multilateral environmental agreements will better support environmental sustainability UNEP will also work with partners to advise on development of \ufb01scal, economic and policy tools and frameworks that take the environment into account, facilitating innovative ways of enhancing \ufb01nance

assess project performance and determine the outcomes and impacts stemming from projects", "They identify lessons of operational relevance for future project design and implementation", "They also feed into the evaluation of subprogrammes by focusing on the role and performance of UNEP in achieving the set of outcomes and impacts that are speci- \ufb01ed in a programme framework and presented in the programme of work", "Evaluation of expected accomplishments will be undertaken at the subprogramme level; these evaluations will examine the achievement of results, relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the delivery of the subprogramme", "In addition, UNEP conducts a formative evaluation of the design of the programme of work at the start of each medium-term strategy", "These assess the causal relationships embedded in the projects within each programme framework and are aimed at determining whether these projects are optimally linked to the expected accomplishments and the higher-level results", "Formative evaluations also help with the identi\ufb01cation of performance measures and key impact drivers that managers can use as they implement their projects and programmes", "The Evaluation Office will also selectively undertake evaluations of service lines (for example, communi- cations awareness-raising and outreach) or effective approaches for bridging the science-policy interface", "The mid-point of the medium-term strategy, namely the end of the biennium 2018-2019, is marked by a meta-evaluation of the progress made in imple- mentation, which will take the form of a biennial evaluation synthesis report", "UNEP will conduct an overall evaluation of the medium-term strategy for 2018-2021 at the end of the medium-term strategy period and will assess progress made towards the achievement of the higher-level results outlined in the strategy", "The aim is to provide evaluative evidence on the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementa- tion and delivery of UNEP; identify challenges in medium-term strategy implementation; and provide lessons and recommendations to guide the future strategic direction of the organization
